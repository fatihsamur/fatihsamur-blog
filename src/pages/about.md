In the long journey of my medical education I also taught myself programming. Over the last 5 years, I have;

*   Built websites and web apps for businesses, nonprofit organizations and for myself,
*   Completed lots of freelance software development work.
*   Created medical applications to automate the repetitive tasks in hospital.

Beside my  web development skills, I have a profound understanding of core principles of programming.

I'm also interested in Artificial Intelligence and Neuroscience. I like to follow the most up-to-date information about those topics and write about them.
